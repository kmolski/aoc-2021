# [Day 23: Amphipod](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23) solution

The first attempt with Haskell failed due to debugging difficulties,
so for this day I went with Python instead.

NOTE: the solution may take several hours to complete.

## Expected result

```
$ ./Amphipod.py example.txt
Part 1: 12521
Part 2: 44169
$ ./Amphipod.py data.txt
Part 1: 14460
Part 2: 41366
```

## Tested on

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.10.4
```
